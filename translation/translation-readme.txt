=== SATORII TRANSLATIONS : NOTE ===

Translation files in this directory are the ones that came with the
Sandbox Theme for localization purposes, updated (but not completed)
to use with Satorii.

If you want to complete a translation or create a new one, you can do it
using poEdit [http://www.poedit.net/ - available for Windows, Mac and
Linux] and the provided "messages.po", which holds all the stuff
(also called "strings", if you're geek enough) that should be
translated.

If you do, you might want to send it to the Satorii Google Code Project
at http://github.com/felipelavinz/satorii so others can also use your
translation.
